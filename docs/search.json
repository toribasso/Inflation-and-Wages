      "contents": "\nWhat is inflation and wages?\nInflation (in the context of this website) is the devaluation of currency over time as the United States Government prints money. As more paper money enters circulation, this creates more supply and devalues the currency. Inflation is not necessarily bad as it helps boost consumer demand and consumption, driving the economy.\nWages are the monetary value of an individual’s work over a period of time. For example, more skilled work has a higher value for the same period of time than less skilled work. A Data Scientist is considered highly skilled and there is a lot of demand with not a lot of data scientists. So, they are paid highly. A fast food worker is not considered highly skilled as many people could perform the job. Therefore, they are paid much less and might be paid minimum wage.\nWhy do we care about inflation and wages?\nInflation is measured by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) who reports the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on a monthly basis and has calculated it as far back as 1913. Consumer Price Index is calculated by averaging the cost of products people need to live. The categories include; food, energy, housing, transportation, apparel, and medical expenses. Inflation is just the change in the Consumer Price Index. See the image below:\n\n(Creative Commons License)(url)\nAs you can see, inflation has been pretty steady since the middle of the 1980s. Recently, inflation was measured at 7.9%. This would rival the 1980 inflation rate, over 40 years ago.\nLets now investigate how wages have changed over time. We can look at cumulative wages since the 1980s:\n\n(Creative Commons License)(url)\nIn this graph we can see what average yearly change in wage growth for each percentile by dividing each by 39 years. Below you can see the percentile growth over time:\nPercentile\nAverage Year Growth\n95th\n1.44%\n70th\n0.44%\n50th\n0.36%\n30th\n0.31%\n10th\n0.10%\nObviously, this does not seem to keep up with our previous inflation graphic which seemed to hover between 1%-5%. This means that while it might seem like you are being paid more over time, you money is worth less and less and it costs you more to live.\n\n\n\n",

This may indicate that there are large outliers influencing the average wage to be higher. If we look at wages-by-degree, it seems like having a degree is much more helpful for wages than not having a degree.\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data=DatasetForRProject, aes(x=Year, y=GeneralMedianWage, group=1)) +\n  geom_line()+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\nggplot(data=DatasetForRProject, aes(x=Year, y=GeneralAverageWage, group=1)) +\n  geom_line()+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nThis seems like average has less point-to-point variation than the median wage category.

There was not a high correlation with wages for some college, High School, and less than High School. This is highly concerning. This means that over time, individuals who receive less than a Bachelor’s degree are not keeping up with inflation as much as a college degree. Also, the correlation is negative for people who do not have a high school diploma. This indicates that as the Consumer Price Index increases over time, people with a high school diploma actually have their wages decrease.\nConclusions\nThe results from the correlations were extremely interesting and shed light on our situation in the United States. Individuals who have a College Degree seem to have wages that keep up with inflation. Those who do not have a degree, but have a high school education, increase over time. But not at the same pace as inflation. The worth of their wages are slowly eroding over time. For those without a high school diploma, their wages actually decrease as inflation increases.\nWith inflation in the United States at a high in recent history, it seems that those with a college diploma will be better off than those without.\n\n\n\n",

This project was initiated by my passion for Personal Finance and my R Programming course STA 518.\nAs of February 2022, the unadjusted Consumer Price Index for the past 12 months was 7.9% (source).
